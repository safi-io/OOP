# Overview
I explored OOP during second semester of University.
# Details
I organized all folders with concept names. So, in future I can easily revise any concept.
# Projects
I tried my best to use every single concept I learned in projects for better understandings.
# Reason
I made this public, So everyone can get a roadmap to how to approach OOP the way I did.
